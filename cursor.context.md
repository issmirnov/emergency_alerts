# Emergency Alerts Integration Development Log

## Project Overview
Development of a comprehensive Emergency Alerts custom integration for Home Assistant, featuring hub-based organization, global settings management, and alert group functionality.

## Major Development Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation & Terminology Changes
- **Goal**: Change terminology from "hubs" to "alert configurations" and add global notification settings
- **Achievements**:
  - Updated strings/translations for terminology changes
  - Added `EmergencyOptionsFlow` with global settings (escalation time, notifications, message templates)
  - Modified binary_sensor.py for global settings access
  - Fixed technical issues with duplicate sensor IDs

### Phase 2: Complete Architecture Restructure
- **Problem**: Each alert created separate hubs, defeating organization purposes
- **Solution**: New hub architecture implementation
  - **Global Settings Hub**: Manages notification settings that apply to all Emergency Alerts
  - **Alert Group Hubs**: Group-based organization with custom names (e.g., "Ivan's Security Alerts")
  - Restructured config_flow.py with hub type selection
  - Group management (add/remove/list alerts)
  - Device grouping in Home Assistant UI
  - Legacy support for existing installations

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes & Core Functionality
- Fixed KeyError bugs in group setup
- Removed deprecated warnings
- Changed from predefined to free-text group names
- Restored detailed form descriptions

## Recent Major Fixes

### Device Structure Problems Resolution
**Issues Identified**:
- Sample entities appearing without actual alerts
- Missing individual alert devices
- Incorrect device hierarchy

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Fixed Sample Entities**: Removed hardcoded group sensors, only create based on actual groups
2. **Restored Missing Toggles**: Created button.py with acknowledge/clear/escalate buttons
3. **Fixed Device Hierarchy**: Each alert gets own device under hub with proper via_device relationships

### Config Flow Improvements
**Problem**: Alerts added via gear menu appeared as "attribute sensors" not devices
**Solution**: Added automatic config entry reloading to add_alert/remove_alert flows for immediate entity creation

## UI & User Experience Enhancements

### Interface Improvements
- Renamed confusing "Environment Hub" to "Emergency Alerts Environment Summary"
- Changed gear menu from dropdown to button-style interface
- Updated strings with emojis: ‚ûï Add New Alert, üóëÔ∏è Remove Alert, üìã List All Alerts
- Clarified device deletion (use "Remove Alert") vs disable functionality

### Status Sensors Implementation
- Added `_cleared` state tracking to binary_sensor.py
- Modified acknowledge/clear/escalate methods for mutual exclusivity
- Added `get_status()` returning: "cleared", "acknowledged", "escalated", "active", "inactive"
- Created `_update_status_sensor()` generating companion sensors like `sensor.emergency_sun_up_status`
- Status sensors show current state with appropriate icons
- Status updates on every state change

## Latest Feature: Edit Alert Functionality

### User Request
User identified missing functionality - no way to edit/reconfigure existing alerts from the list.

### Implementation
**Added to config_flow.py**:
- "edit_alert" action option when alerts exist
- `async_step_edit_alert()`: Two-step process for alert selection
- `async_step_edit_alert_form()`: Edit form with pre-filled values
- Smart naming: If name changes, alert ID updates accordingly
- Automatic config entry reloading for immediate updates

**UI Strings Enhanced**:
- Added edit functionality to strings.json and translations/en.json
- Restored detailed `data_description` sections with helpful examples
- Maintained user-friendly guidance and field explanations

### Current Alert Management Options
1. **‚ûï Add New Alert** - Create a new alert
2. **‚úèÔ∏è Edit Alert** - **NEW!** Edit an existing alert
3. **üóëÔ∏è Remove Alert** - Delete an alert
4. **üìã List All Alerts** - View all alerts

## Phase 4: Menu-Style Interface & Documentation Update

### User Experience Improvements
**Problem**: Dropdown selectors showed ugly raw enum values and included useless "list_alerts" option
**Solution**: Complete interface redesign
- **Removed useless "list_alerts"** functionality entirely
- **Implemented menu-style interface** using `async_show_menu()` instead of dropdown + submit
- **Beautiful action buttons**: ‚ûï Add New Alert, ‚úèÔ∏è Edit Alert, üóëÔ∏è Remove Alert
- **Dynamic menu**: Edit/Remove options only appear when alerts exist
- **Immediate action**: No more dropdown ‚Üí submit workflow, direct button ‚Üí action

### Edit Alert Enhancements
**Improved edit workflow**:
- **Two-step process**: Select alert ‚Üí Edit form
- **Rich alert selection**: Shows "Alert Name (Type: simple, Severity: warning)" format
- **Comprehensive edit form**: All fields pre-filled with current values
- **Action choice**: Save changes OR delete alert from same screen
- **Smart updates**: Alert ID changes automatically if name is modified

### Documentation Alignment
**Major documentation overhaul**:
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Complete rewrite to reflect hub-based architecture, device hierarchy, menu interface, and current feature set
- **README.md**: User-focused rewrite with modern formatting, clear setup instructions, and examples matching current implementation
- **Feature documentation**: All docs now accurately represent the current state with hub organization, button entities, status tracking, and menu-style management

## Current Alert Management Options (Final)
1. **‚ûï Add New Alert** - Create a new alert
2. **‚úèÔ∏è Edit Alert** - Edit an existing alert with pre-filled form + delete option
3. **üóëÔ∏è Remove Alert** - Delete an alert

## Current Technical Architecture

### File Structure
- **binary_sensor.py**: Main alert entities with status tracking
- **button.py**: Interactive action buttons (acknowledge/clear/escalate)
- **sensor.py**: Summary sensors and hub devices
- **config_flow.py**: Setup and management UI with full CRUD operations
- **strings.json/translations/**: User interface strings with detailed descriptions

### Key Features
- Device hierarchy with via_device relationships
- Automatic config reloading on changes
- Status tracking with companion sensor entities
- Global vs group hub separation
- Legacy installation support
- Comprehensive edit functionality with pre-filled forms

## Current Working State
Based on debug logs and testing:
- ‚úÖ Hub-based architecture functioning (global/group organization)
- ‚úÖ Individual alert devices properly created under hubs
- ‚úÖ Button entities working (acknowledge/clear/escalate)
- ‚úÖ Status sensors created and updating
- ‚úÖ Config entry reloading working for immediate entity creation
- ‚úÖ Improved hub sensor naming
- ‚úÖ **Menu-style interface implemented** with beautiful action buttons
- ‚úÖ **Edit alert functionality** with pre-filled forms and delete option
- ‚úÖ **Documentation fully updated** to reflect current implementation

## Next Steps
- **Integration is feature-complete** for current requirements
- Test comprehensive functionality in Home Assistant UI
- Verify all menu buttons work correctly
- Ensure edit workflow functions smoothly
- Monitor for any edge cases in real-world usage
- **Ready for community use and feedback**

## Development Notes
- User prefers detailed explanatory strings in UI forms
- Button entities chosen over switches for one-time actions
- Status sensors provide valuable state tracking for automation
- Menu-style interface much cleaner than dropdown + submit approach
- Documentation now accurately reflects the sophisticated hub-based architecture and modern UI
