# Emergency Alerts Integration Development Log

## Project Overview
Development of a comprehensive Emergency Alerts custom integration for Home Assistant, featuring hub-based organization, global settings management, and alert group functionality.

## Major Development Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation & Terminology Changes
- **Goal**: Change terminology from "hubs" to "alert configurations" and add global notification settings
- **Achievements**:
  - Updated strings/translations for terminology changes
  - Added `EmergencyOptionsFlow` with global settings (escalation time, notifications, message templates)
  - Modified binary_sensor.py for global settings access
  - Fixed technical issues with duplicate sensor IDs

### Phase 2: Complete Architecture Restructure
- **Problem**: Each alert created separate hubs, defeating organization purposes
- **Solution**: New hub architecture implementation
  - **Global Settings Hub**: Manages notification settings that apply to all Emergency Alerts
  - **Alert Group Hubs**: Group-based organization with custom names (e.g., "Ivan's Security Alerts")
  - Restructured config_flow.py with hub type selection
  - Group management (add/remove/list alerts)
  - Device grouping in Home Assistant UI
  - Legacy support for existing installations

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes & Core Functionality
- Fixed KeyError bugs in group setup
- Removed deprecated warnings
- Changed from predefined to free-text group names
- Restored detailed form descriptions

## Recent Major Fixes

### Device Structure Problems Resolution
**Issues Identified**:
- Sample entities appearing without actual alerts
- Missing individual alert devices
- Incorrect device hierarchy

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Fixed Sample Entities**: Removed hardcoded group sensors, only create based on actual groups
2. **Restored Missing Toggles**: Created button.py with acknowledge/clear/escalate buttons
3. **Fixed Device Hierarchy**: Each alert gets own device under hub with proper via_device relationships

### Config Flow Improvements
**Problem**: Alerts added via gear menu appeared as "attribute sensors" not devices
**Solution**: Added automatic config entry reloading to add_alert/remove_alert flows for immediate entity creation

## UI & User Experience Enhancements

### Interface Improvements
- Renamed confusing "Environment Hub" to "Emergency Alerts Environment Summary"
- Changed gear menu from dropdown to button-style interface
- Updated strings with emojis: ‚ûï Add New Alert, üóëÔ∏è Remove Alert, üìã List All Alerts
- Clarified device deletion (use "Remove Alert") vs disable functionality

### Status Sensors Implementation
- Added `_cleared` state tracking to binary_sensor.py
- Modified acknowledge/clear/escalate methods for mutual exclusivity
- Added `get_status()` returning: "cleared", "acknowledged", "escalated", "active", "inactive"
- Created `_update_status_sensor()` generating companion sensors like `sensor.emergency_sun_up_status`
- Status sensors show current state with appropriate icons
- Status updates on every state change

## Latest Feature: Edit Alert Functionality

### User Request
User identified missing functionality - no way to edit/reconfigure existing alerts from the list.

### Implementation
**Added to config_flow.py**:
- "edit_alert" action option when alerts exist
- `async_step_edit_alert()`: Two-step process for alert selection
- `async_step_edit_alert_form()`: Edit form with pre-filled values
- Smart naming: If name changes, alert ID updates accordingly
- Automatic config entry reloading for immediate updates

**UI Strings Enhanced**:
- Added edit functionality to strings.json and translations/en.json
- Restored detailed `data_description` sections with helpful examples
- Maintained user-friendly guidance and field explanations

### Current Alert Management Options
1. **‚ûï Add New Alert** - Create a new alert
2. **‚úèÔ∏è Edit Alert** - **NEW!** Edit an existing alert
3. **üóëÔ∏è Remove Alert** - Delete an alert
4. **üìã List All Alerts** - View all alerts

## Phase 4: Menu-Style Interface & Documentation Update

### User Experience Improvements
**Problem**: Dropdown selectors showed ugly raw enum values and included useless "list_alerts" option
**Solution**: Complete interface redesign
- **Removed useless "list_alerts"** functionality entirely
- **Implemented menu-style interface** using `async_show_menu()` instead of dropdown + submit
- **Beautiful action buttons**: ‚ûï Add New Alert, ‚úèÔ∏è Edit Alert, üóëÔ∏è Remove Alert
- **Dynamic menu**: Edit/Remove options only appear when alerts exist
- **Immediate action**: No more dropdown ‚Üí submit workflow, direct button ‚Üí action

### Edit Alert Enhancements
**Improved edit workflow**:
- **Two-step process**: Select alert ‚Üí Edit form
- **Rich alert selection**: Shows "Alert Name (Type: simple, Severity: warning)" format
- **Comprehensive edit form**: All fields pre-filled with current values
- **Action choice**: Save changes OR delete alert from same screen
- **Smart updates**: Alert ID changes automatically if name is modified

### Documentation Alignment
**Major documentation overhaul**:
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Complete rewrite to reflect hub-based architecture, device hierarchy, menu interface, and current feature set
- **README.md**: User-focused rewrite with modern formatting, clear setup instructions, and examples matching current implementation
- **Feature documentation**: All docs now accurately represent the current state with hub organization, button entities, status tracking, and menu-style management

## Phase 5: Multi-Step Alert Creation & Service Integration

### User Request: Streamlined Alert Creation
**Problem**: Single-step alert creation was overwhelming with too many fields at once
**Solution**: Multi-step, branching config flow implementation

### Implementation Details
**Step 1: Basic Information Collection**
- **Name**: Descriptive alert name (e.g., "Front Door Open", "High Temperature")
- **Trigger Type**: Beautiful dropdown with emojis and descriptions:
  - üîç **Simple** - Monitor a single entity's state
  - üìù **Template** - Use Jinja2 templates for complex conditions
  - üîó **Logical** - Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic
- **Severity**: Enhanced dropdown with emojis:
  - üö® **Critical** - Immediate attention required
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** - Important but not urgent
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info** - Informational alerts

**Step 2: Trigger-Specific Configuration**
- **Simple Triggers**: Entity ID and trigger state selection
- **Template Triggers**: Jinja2 template input with helpful examples
- **Logical Triggers**: Dynamic condition builder with entity/state pairs and operator selection

**Step 3: Action Configuration**
- **Service Dropdowns**: Dynamic dropdowns of available Home Assistant services instead of text inputs
- **Action Types**: Triggered, cleared, and escalated state actions
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible defaults for all optional fields

### Technical Implementation
**Dynamic Service Discovery**:
- Added `_get_available_services()` method to fetch all available Home Assistant services
- Services filtered and formatted for user-friendly display
- Dropdowns populated with actual available services
- Proper service validation and error handling

**UI Enhancements**:
- **Prettier Dropdowns**: All dropdowns now use `selector.SelectOptionDict` with value/label pairs
- **Emoji Integration**: Visual indicators for trigger types and severity levels
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Forms adapt based on user selections
- **Comprehensive Help**: Detailed descriptions and examples throughout

### String Updates
**Enhanced User Interface**:
- Updated `TRIGGER_TYPE_OPTIONS` with emojis and colon-separated descriptions
- Updated `SEVERITY_OPTIONS` with emojis and clear descriptions
- Added comprehensive help text for all form fields
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing installations

### Translation Updates
**Internationalization Support**:
- Updated English translations to match new UI strings

## 2025-01-22 - Visual Condition Builder for Logical Triggers

**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Summary**: Implemented a user-friendly visual condition builder for logical triggers, replacing the complex JSON input with an intuitive form-based interface.

**Problem**: Users found it difficult to write JSON format for logical conditions like `[{"entity_id": "sensor.openweather", "state": "rain"}, {"entity_id": "binary_sensor.garage_door", "state": "on"}]`. This required knowledge of JSON syntax and was error-prone.

**Solution**: Created a visual condition builder that:
- Provides up to 10 entity/state pairs with dropdown selectors
- Includes AND/OR operator selection with clear descriptions
- Automatically parses form data into the required JSON format
- Supports editing existing logical conditions
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing configurations

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Config Flow**: Updated `async_step_add_alert_trigger_logical()` to build dynamic schema with entity selectors
- **Binary Sensor**: Enhanced `_evaluate_trigger()` to support both AND/OR operators
- **Data Structure**: Added `logical_operator` field to alert configuration
- **UI Strings**: Updated strings.json and translations with comprehensive field descriptions

**Code References**:
- `config_flow.py`: Lines 339-400 - Visual condition builder implementation
- `binary_sensor.py`: Lines 344-362 - Enhanced logical condition evaluation
- `strings.json`: Lines 140-160 - Updated UI strings and descriptions

**Benefits**:
- **User Experience**: No more JSON syntax errors or complex formatting
- **Accessibility**: Visual interface makes logical conditions accessible to all users
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex scenarios like "rain AND garage open OR motion detected"
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure with better error handling

**Example Usage**:
```
Logical Operator: AND - All conditions must be true
Condition 1: sensor.openweather = "rain"
Condition 2: binary_sensor.garage_door = "on"
Result: Alert triggers when it's raining AND the garage door is open
```
