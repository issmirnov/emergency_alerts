No unreleased changes.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-05-26

Mostly a bug-fix release that papers over six rough edges in v4.1.0, plus one
genuinely new feature: a top-level `for_seconds` field that gives every alert a
HA-native sustain-duration debounce.

### Added

- **`for_seconds` debounce field.** New top-level alert config that delays
  triggering until the underlying condition has been continuously true for the
  given number of seconds (HA `for:` semantics). Applies uniformly to simple,
  template, and logical triggers. Cleanly cancels the dwell when the condition
  flaps. Default `0` keeps old behavior. ([#18](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/18))

### Fixed

- **Template-trigger alerts never re-evaluated.** `async_track_state_change_event(hass, [], …)` was subscribing to an empty entity list, so template-triggered alerts latched on/off until the next integration reload. Switched to `async_track_template_result`, which subscribes to the entities referenced inside the Jinja template. ([#14](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/14))
- **`on_triggered_script` UI field was silently ignored.** The script entity selected in the config flow was stored on the alert but never wired into action execution. Added `_resolve_on_triggered()` in `binary_sensor.py` to synthesize a `script.turn_on` call from the field. ([#13](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/13))
- **Duplicate / mangled entity IDs.** HA was slugify-combining device name + entity name into IDs like `binary_sensor.emergency_alert_<name>_emergency_<name>`. `binary_sensor`, `select`, and `sensor` platforms now pin `self.entity_id` explicitly so new alerts get clean IDs. Existing alerts in the entity registry are unaffected. ([#13](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/13))
- **Select entity showed "unknown" for inactive alerts.** `STATE_INACTIVE` (and `STATE_ESCALATED`) were not in the select's `ALERT_STATES` option list, so the widget rendered `unknown` whenever the alert was off. Added both to the options list. ([#12](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/12))
- **Alert IDs broke on names with special characters.** Names like `Smoke/CO Detector (Triggered)` produced alert IDs with slashes and parens, which broke remove-alert lookups and entity-ID derivation. Added `_slugify_alert_id()` in `config_flow.py` to collapse non-alphanumeric runs into single underscores. ([#12](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/12))
- **Hub summary sensor reported configured count instead of active count.** `sensor.emergency_alerts_<hub>_summary` was emitting the total number of alerts ever configured on the hub, which made it useless for visibility gating on the dashboard ("show this section when any alert in this hub is firing"). The state is now the count of currently-triggered alerts on the hub, computed via the existing `SUMMARY_UPDATE_SIGNAL` dispatcher. ([#16](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/16))
- **EntitySelector fields rejected empty submissions.** Leaving an EntitySelector blank on the add/edit alert form raised "Entity not found" because `vol.Optional(key, default="")` was injecting an empty string that EntitySelector then validated against the entity registry. Switched to `description={"suggested_value": ...}` pre-fill via a new `_optional()` helper so unset fields go through cleanly. Removes the long-standing "EntitySelector fields must not have default values" caveat. ([#20](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/20))

### Changed

- Relocated all dev scripts into `scripts/` (`run_tests.sh`, `lint.sh`, `fix-format.sh`, `docker-test.sh`, `update-card.sh`, `validate_integration.py`, `validate_translations.py`). CI workflow updated to match. Dropped obsolete LLM-era docs from repo root. ([#15](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/15))
- Added MIT `LICENSE` file (was referenced by README but missing on disk).
- Added an automated "architect-gate" PR review workflow that posts a System Architecture Review on every PR. ([#19](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/19))

### Documentation

- README rewritten to focus on what the integration does, with concrete configuration examples and a link to the companion Lovelace card. ([#17](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/17))
- `CLAUDE.md` gained Repository Layout, Local Verification, and CI Gotchas sections, plus the conventions surfaced by recent fix PRs (entity-ID pinning, `on_triggered_script` resolution, alert-ID slugification, `async_track_template_result` for templates).
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and badges across the README. ([#17](https://github.com/issmirnov/emergency_alerts/pull/17))

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-10

Major polish release. Focused on UX, testing infrastructure, and Home Assistant 2026.2 compatibility.

### Added

- **Single-page config flow** (Adaptive Lighting pattern) — all alert options on one scrollable form instead of a multi-step wizard.
- **Full edit & remove flows** with pre-filled forms and field-default preservation.
- **Instant entity updates** after add / edit / remove via `config_entries.async_reload()` — no HA restart needed.
- **User-friendly field labels** and template-testing guidance on every config-flow field.
- **Hassfest validation** in CI.
- **Translation sync validation** via `scripts/validate_translations.py` (run in CI) plus an autouse pytest fixture in `conftest.py` that fails any test with a "Failed to format translation" log line.
- **Playwright E2E test** for config flow with console-error monitoring (`e2e-tests/tests/03-config-flow-add-alert.spec.ts`).
- **Comprehensive testing docs** (`docs/TESTING.md`).
- **Automated dev environment** via `dev_tools/local-dev.sh` — trusted-network auth bypass, auto-creates sun integration + 2 test alerts, registers dashboard + card resources on startup.

### Changed

- **Config flow code**: 1,371 → 366 lines (~73% reduction) in `config_flow.py`.
- **Script storage**: actions stored as entity-ID string (`{"script": "script.notify_phone"}`) instead of nested action array. Migration logic handles the legacy array format.
- **Card V4** (separate repo): switched from `switch.toggle` to `select.select_option`; cache-busting via `?v=4.0.0` resource parameter.
- **Modern selectors** (`EntitySelector`, `TemplateSelector`) replace bare text inputs across the config flow.
- **Docker dev environment** pinned to Home Assistant `2026.2` (never `:latest`).

### Fixed

- 40+ translation-string mismatches between `strings.json` and `translations/en.json`.
- HA 2026.2 `OptionsFlow.config_entry` is read-only — removed custom `__init__` from `OptionsFlow` subclasses.
- `async_show_menu` doesn't support `description_placeholders` — switched to `async_show_form` where placeholders were needed.

### Known incompatibilities

- `EntitySelector` fields must not have default values. A `default=""` triggers "Entity not found" validation. Leave EntitySelectors unset by default.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-04

### Changed (BREAKING)

Replaced 3 switches per alert with 1 select entity for unified state control.

**Migration:**
- Old: `switch.{alert_name}_acknowledged`, `switch.{alert_name}_snoozed`, `switch.{alert_name}_resolved`
- New: `select.{alert_name}_state` with options: `active`, `acknowledged`, `snoozed`, `resolved`
- Update automations from `switch.turn_on` to `select.select_option`:
  ```yaml
  service: select.select_option
  data:
    entity_id: select.door_alert_state
    option: acknowledged
  ```

**Benefits:** 67% fewer entities, single dropdown instead of 3 toggles, simpler state management, better alignment with HA 2026.2 patterns.

### Added

- New `select` platform for unified alert state control.
- Automatic state syncing with the alert binary sensor.

### Deprecated

- `switch.py` is deprecated and will be removed in v5.0.0.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- Auto-migration for old config entries missing the `group` field.
- Translation error: `group_name was not provided`.

### Added
- Debug logging for config-entry diagnostics.
- Local Docker-based development environment.
- Mock-HA development testing framework.
- Translation audit tool.
- Import validation tests.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- Translation placeholder errors in config flow.
- Missing `group_name` in `description_placeholders`.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- `ImportError` for the removed `TRIGGER_TYPE_COMBINED` constant.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-04

### Changed
- Removed the separate Global Settings Hub — no longer required.
- Config flow goes directly to alert-group creation.
- Simple / template triggers use a single unified form; logical triggers use a multi-step wizard.
- Removed "combined" trigger type (superseded by logical).

### Added
- Unified single-page alert creation form.
- Smart form that adapts based on trigger type.
- Entity autocomplete in the config flow.
- Notification profiles at group level.
- Modular trigger evaluator and action executor under `core/`.
- Comprehensive local testing framework.
