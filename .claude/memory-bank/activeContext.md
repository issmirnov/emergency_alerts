## Current Focus

**Phase: Lovelace Card v2.0.2 Bug Fixes (2025-10-30)**

Fixing critical bug in Lovelace card where button clicks (acknowledge/snooze/resolve) don't update alert states. Root cause: entity ID conversion bug in alert-service.ts.

Recent work completed:
1. ✅ Identified root cause: _convertToSwitchId() not stripping "emergency_" prefix
2. ✅ Fixed bug in lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/src/services/alert-service.ts:37-46
3. ✅ Built updated card with npm run build
4. ✅ Created build-and-deploy.sh helper script for future deploys
5. ✅ Verified fix is present in dist/emergency-alerts-card.js (grep confirmed)
6. ✅ Deployed to HA container (config/www/emergency-alerts-card.js)
7. ✅ Restarted Home Assistant container to clear server-side cache

**Current Issue**: Browser caching - fix deployed but browser still loads old JavaScript (2025-10-30)

**Previous Phase Complete**: E2E Testing Infrastructure (2025-10-30)

**Previous Phase Complete**: v2.0 State Machine Redesign with notification profiles (2025-10-29)

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-30: Lovelace Card Button Click Bug Fix (CRITICAL)
- **Changed**: Fixed _convertToSwitchId() in alert-service.ts to strip "emergency_" prefix
- **Why**: Button clicks (acknowledge/snooze/resolve) were calling wrong entity IDs, causing state updates to fail
- **Bug Details**:
  - Binary sensors: `binary_sensor.emergency_critical_test_alert`
  - Old code generated: `switch.emergency_critical_test_alert_acknowledged` ❌
  - Actual switch entities: `switch.critical_test_alert_acknowledged` ✅
  - Root cause: Integration creates switches WITHOUT "emergency_" prefix
- **Files**:
  - lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/src/services/alert-service.ts:37-46 (added prefix stripping)
  - lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/build-and-deploy.sh (new helper script)
  - lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/dist/emergency-alerts-card.js (rebuilt)
  - emergency-alerts-integration/config/www/emergency-alerts-card.js (deployed)
- **Status**: ✅ Fix complete and deployed, ⚠️ Browser cache issue preventing verification
- **Testing**: User manually clicked buttons, confirmed state not updating (browser loading old JS)

### 2025-10-30: E2E Testing Infrastructure (MAJOR)

- **Why**: Enable persistent context across AI sessions
- **Impact**: Full project context available for all future work

### 2025-01-22: Visual Condition Builder
- **Changed**: Replaced JSON input with visual form builder for logical triggers
- **Why**: JSON syntax was error-prone and difficult for non-technical users
- **Impact**: Logical triggers now accessible to all users, significantly better UX
- **Files**:
  - custom_components/emergency_alerts/config_flow.py:339-400
  - custom_components/emergency_alerts/binary_sensor.py:344-362

## Active Decisions

### Decision in Progress: Notification Profile Implementation
- **Question**: How complex should notification profiles be?
- **Options**:
  1. **Simple** - Just named groups of service calls
  2. **Advanced** - Include variables, templating, conditional logic
  3. **Hybrid** - Start simple, add features later
- **Leaning Towards**: Hybrid - simple named profiles first
- **Status**: In implementation

### Recently Resolved Decisions

#### Switch Platform Implementation ✅
- **Decision**: Complete rewrite with 3 switch types
- **Result**: acknowledge, snooze (auto-expiring), resolve implemented
- **Impact**: Major UX improvement, visible state management

#### Button Platform Removal ✅
- **Decision**: Clean break, no backward compatibility
- **Result**: Removed button.py entirely
- **Impact**: Breaking change for v2.0, requires user migration

### Blocked/Waiting
- [ ] HACS listing approval - **Blocked by**: Need to submit to HACS store
- [ ] User feedback collection - **Blocked by**: Need wider distribution

## Current Challenges

- **Browser Cache Issues with Lovelace Card**: After deploying card fixes, browser aggressively caches JavaScript
  - **Issue**: Fix is in dist file and HA container, but browser loads old code even after hard refresh
  - **Impact**: Cannot verify button click fixes without clearing cache
  - **Attempted**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R), HA container restart
  - **Next Steps**: Try different browser, clear all browser data, or add cache-busting query parameter

- **Playwright Shadow DOM Access**: Home Assistant's deep shadow DOM nesting prevents automated testing
  - **Issue**: Cannot access emergency-alerts-card shadow DOM via playwright_evaluate
  - **Hierarchy**: home-assistant → home-assistant-main → partial-panel-resolver (no shadowRoot) → ...
  - **Impact**: Manual testing required for button clicks
  - **Workaround**: Use manual testing or develop shadow DOM piercing function

- **Testing Runtime Behavior**: Some issues only appear in full Home Assistant runtime, not in pytest
  - **Approach**: Using devcontainer for live testing, diagnostics.py for debugging

- **Balancing Features vs Simplicity**: Temptation to add more features vs keeping integration focused
  - **Approach**: Deferring non-critical features, focusing on stability and core experience

- **Documentation Drift**: Multiple doc files (README, ARCHITECTURE, cursor.context.md) can get out of sync
  - **Approach**: Memory bank now serves as canonical source, other docs reference it

## Open Questions

- Should global settings hub be more integrated with alert groups? Currently underutilized
- Is the hub architecture clear to users, or does it need better onboarding docs/tutorial?
- What's the migration path for users who installed during pre-hub era?
- Should we provide UI for viewing alert history, or rely on HA's history integration?

## Recently Resolved

- **Button-based state confusion (v2.0)** - **Solution**: Complete redesign to switch-based state machine with mutual exclusivity
- **Snooze timing persistence (v2.0)** - **Solution**: Store snooze_until timestamp, survives HA restarts
- **Visual condition builder complexity** - **Solution**: Implemented form-based interface with dynamic entity/state pairs (2025-01-22)
- **Config entry reload timing** - **Solution**: Call async_reload immediately after updating config entry data for instant entity creation
- **Status sensor duplication** - **Solution**: Check entity registry before creating companion status sensors
- **Legacy hub-per-alert problem** - **Solution**: Complete architecture restructure to two-tier hub system (Phase 3)

## Context Notes

### AI Development Approach
This project is intentionally developed with heavy AI assistance (Claude/Cursor). The maintainer has limited deep knowledge of the codebase, which makes memory bank critical for continuity. AI sessions should:
1. Always read memory bank first
2. Reference memory bank files for context
3. Update memory bank after significant changes
4. Use defensive coding patterns due to limited human oversight

### Testing Philosophy
- Maintain >90% coverage
- Focus on critical paths (alert evaluation, state transitions)
- Use pytest for unit/integration tests
- Manual testing in devcontainer for runtime behavior
- Diagnostics available for troubleshooting user issues

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow Home Assistant best practices
- Use defensive coding (extensive error handling)
- Log errors but don't crash HA
- Validate all user inputs
- No external dependencies

### User Communication
- Be transparent about AI-assisted development
- Encourage community contributions
- Provide clear, helpful error messages
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain detailed changelog (cursor.context.md)

### Current Project Health
- ✅ Core features complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ HACS validation passing
- ✅ No known critical bugs
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ⏳ Awaiting wider user feedback
- ⏳ Monitoring for edge cases in real-world usage
