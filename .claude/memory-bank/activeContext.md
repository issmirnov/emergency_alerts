## Current Focus

**Phase: v3 Combined Triggers & Reminder Model (2025-12-10)**

Shipped combined trigger type (two conditions with comparators and AND/OR) plus per-alert reminder timer; cleaned escalation semantics and aligned frontend status gating.

**COMPLETED WORK (2025-12-10)**:
1. ✅ Added combined trigger type and parsing in binary_sensor/config_flow
2. ✅ Added per-alert reminder (`remind_after_seconds`) reusing on-trigger actions
3. ✅ Cleared escalations on ack/snooze/resolve/condition clear
4. ✅ Frontend gates status on entity state to avoid stale escalations
5. ✅ Manifest bumped to 3.0.0; card package bumped to 3.0.0
6. ✅ Backend tests via `./run_tests.sh` (venv) all pass
7. ✅ Frontend lint/tests/build all pass
8. ✅ Docs updated with combined trigger examples and reminder property

## Recent Changes

### 2025-12-10: v3 Combined Trigger + Reminder Model
- Added combined trigger type (two conditions with comparators and AND/OR) to simplify common cases without templates.
- Introduced per-alert reminder timer (`remind_after_seconds`) that re-runs on-trigger actions; escalations now clear on ack/snooze/resolve/clear.
- Frontend status badges now gate on entity state to avoid stale escalations.
- Manifest bumped to 3.0.0; backend + frontend tests and lint pass.

### 2025-10-31: Device Identifier Standardization (CRITICAL BUG FIX)
- **Changed**: Standardized device identifiers across all platforms to use `entry.entry_id`
- **Why**: Inconsistent device identifiers caused switches to appear as separate "Unnamed device"
- **Bug Details**:
  - Hub sensor used: `{hub_name}_hub` (e.g., `test_alerts_hub`)
  - Binary sensor used: `{hub_name}_{alert_id}` (e.g., `test_alerts_critical_test`)
  - Switches used: `alert_{entry.entry_id}_{alert_id}` ✅ (e.g., `alert_HZBABGAT26NRXVT9QNNZ70DN7X_critical_test`)
  - Mismatch prevented switches from linking to binary sensor device
- **Files Changed**:
  - custom_components/emergency_alerts/sensor.py:109 (hub device identifier)
  - custom_components/emergency_alerts/binary_sensor.py:158 (alert device identifier)
  - custom_components/emergency_alerts/binary_sensor.py:163 (alert via_device reference)
- **New Device Identifier Pattern**:
  - Hub device: `hub_{entry.entry_id}`
  - Alert device: `alert_{entry.entry_id}_{alert_id}`
  - Via device: `hub_{entry.entry_id}`
- **Testing Performed**:
  - ✅ All 35 backend pytest tests pass
  - ✅ Integration loads with new identifiers
  - ✅ Device registry structure verified
  - ✅ CI/CD all checks passed (Backend, HACS, Integration, Lint)
- **Breaking Change**: Device identifiers can't change in-place in HA
  - Existing users see old devices + new unnamed stub devices
  - Migration: Remove and re-add integration
  - Impact: Minimal (single user - project maintainer)
- **Additional Discovery**: Hub devices created AFTER alerts causes via_device warning
  - Warning: "Detected non existing via_device... This will stop working in HA 2025.12.0"
  - Root cause: async_setup_entry creates binary sensors before hub sensor
  - **Action Item**: Create follow-up issue to fix setup order
- **PR**: #6 created with comprehensive documentation
- **Status**: ✅ All CI/CD passed, ready for merge

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-30: Lovelace Card Button Click Bug Fix (CRITICAL)
- **Changed**: Fixed _convertToSwitchId() in alert-service.ts to strip "emergency_" prefix
- **Why**: Button clicks (acknowledge/snooze/resolve) were calling wrong entity IDs, causing state updates to fail
- **Bug Details**:
  - Binary sensors: `binary_sensor.emergency_critical_test_alert`
  - Old code generated: `switch.emergency_critical_test_alert_acknowledged` ❌
  - Actual switch entities: `switch.critical_test_alert_acknowledged` ✅
  - Root cause: Integration creates switches WITHOUT "emergency_" prefix
- **Files**:
  - lovelace-emergency-alerts-card/src/services/alert-service.ts:37-46 (added prefix stripping)

- **Options**:
  1. **Simple** - Just named groups of service calls
  2. **Advanced** - Include variables, templating, conditional logic
  3. **Hybrid** - Start simple, add features later
- **Leaning Towards**: Hybrid - simple named profiles first
- **Status**: In implementation

### Recently Resolved Decisions

#### Switch Platform Implementation ✅
- **Decision**: Complete rewrite with 3 switch types
- **Result**: acknowledge, snooze (auto-expiring), resolve implemented
- **Impact**: Major UX improvement, visible state management

#### Button Platform Removal ✅
- **Decision**: Clean break, no backward compatibility
- **Result**: Removed button.py entirely
- **Impact**: Breaking change for v2.0, requires user migration

## Lessons Learned (2025-10-31 Bug Fix Session)

### What Worked Brilliantly ✅

1. **Cache-Busting Query Parameters**: Standard HA pattern solved browser caching instantly
   - Added `?v=2.0.3-bugfix` to resource URL in configuration.yaml
   - Browser treated it as completely new file
   - **Lesson**: Always use query params for HA frontend development

2. **Systematic Debugging**: Root cause identified through console interceptors
   - Wrapped alertService methods with logging
   - Traced exact entity IDs being generated vs actual entity IDs
   - **Lesson**: Console interceptors are invaluable for frontend debugging

3. **Docker Development Stack**: Environment worked perfectly
   - Volume mounts correct
   - Integration loaded properly
   - Card deployment working
   - **Lesson**: Docker Compose setup is solid, keep using it

4. **Build Pipeline**: npm + build-and-deploy.sh script efficient
   - `npm run build` → `build-and-deploy.sh` → restart HA
   - **Lesson**: Helper scripts save time and reduce errors

### What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Hard Refresh for Cache Clearing**: Insufficient for JavaScript modules
   - Ctrl+Shift+R didn't clear cache
   - Container restart didn't help
   - **Lesson**: Modern browsers cache aggressively, need query params

2. **Playwright Shadow DOM Traversal**: Cannot access HA's nested shadow DOM
   - partial-panel-resolver lacks accessible shadowRoot
   - Cannot automate button clicks
   - **Lesson**: Manual testing required for HA Lovelace cards, or use specialized tools

3. **Going in Circles**: Spent time on wrong problem (automation vs caching)
   - Tried to automate testing when caching was the real issue
   - **Lesson**: Identify the actual blocker first, don't over-engineer

### Key Technical Insights 🔍

1. **Integration Entity Naming**: Backend strips "emergency_" prefix from switch entity IDs
   - Binary sensors: `binary_sensor.emergency_*`
   - Switches: `switch.*_acknowledged` (NO emergency_ prefix)
   - **Root cause of bug**

2. **Browser Caching Layers**: Multiple cache levels to consider
   - Browser HTTP cache
   - Service worker cache
   - Query parameters bypass all of them
   - **Solution for HA dev**

3. **Testing Strategy**: E2E testing for HA cards requires different approach
   - Playwright limited for shadow DOM
   - hass-taste-test mentioned in external LLM notes as specialized tool
   - Manual testing still valuable and often faster
   - **Hybrid approach best**

### Process Improvements 📝

1. **Memory Bank System**: Extremely effective for context preservation
   - External LLM notes integrated via e2e-testing-notes.md
   - Active context tracking prevented re-work
   - **Keep using aggressively**

2. **Commit Frequency**: Regular commits with detailed messages helpful
   - Committed after fix, after tests, after config changes
   - Easy to track progress
   - **Best practice**

3. **Planning Mode**: Helped break "going in circles" pattern
   - Forced analysis of actual problem
   - Simplified solution emerged
   - **Use when stuck**

### Resolved Challenges ✅

- **Browser Cache Issues**: SOLVED with query parameter approach
- **Playwright Shadow DOM Access**: ACCEPTED limitation, use manual testing
- **Button Click Bug**: FIXED by stripping "emergency_" prefix in _convertToSwitchId()

- **Testing Runtime Behavior**: Some issues only appear in full Home Assistant runtime, not in pytest
  - **Approach**: Using devcontainer for live testing, diagnostics.py for debugging

- **Balancing Features vs Simplicity**: Temptation to add more features vs keeping integration focused
  - **Approach**: Deferring non-critical features, focusing on stability and core experience

- **Documentation Drift**: Multiple doc files (README, ARCHITECTURE, cursor.context.md) can get out of sync
  - **Approach**: Memory bank now serves as canonical source, other docs reference it

## Open Questions

- Should global settings hub be more integrated with alert groups? Currently underutilized
- Is the hub architecture clear to users, or does it need better onboarding docs/tutorial?
- What's the migration path for users who installed during pre-hub era?
- Should we provide UI for viewing alert history, or rely on HA's history integration?

## Recently Resolved

- **Button-based state confusion (v2.0)** - **Solution**: Complete redesign to switch-based state machine with mutual exclusivity
- **Snooze timing persistence (v2.0)** - **Solution**: Store snooze_until timestamp, survives HA restarts
- **Visual condition builder complexity** - **Solution**: Implemented form-based interface with dynamic entity/state pairs (2025-01-22)
- **Config entry reload timing** - **Solution**: Call async_reload immediately after updating config entry data for instant entity creation
- **Status sensor duplication** - **Solution**: Check entity registry before creating companion status sensors
- **Legacy hub-per-alert problem** - **Solution**: Complete architecture restructure to two-tier hub system (Phase 3)

## Context Notes

### AI Development Approach
This project is intentionally developed with heavy AI assistance (Claude/Cursor). The maintainer has limited deep knowledge of the codebase, which makes memory bank critical for continuity. AI sessions should:
1. Always read memory bank first
2. Reference memory bank files for context
3. Update memory bank after significant changes
4. Use defensive coding patterns due to limited human oversight

### Testing Philosophy
- Maintain >90% coverage
- Focus on critical paths (alert evaluation, state transitions)
- Use pytest for unit/integration tests
- Manual testing in devcontainer for runtime behavior
- Diagnostics available for troubleshooting user issues

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow Home Assistant best practices
- Use defensive coding (extensive error handling)
- Log errors but don't crash HA
- Validate all user inputs
- No external dependencies

### User Communication
- Be transparent about AI-assisted development
- Encourage community contributions
- Provide clear, helpful error messages
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain detailed changelog (cursor.context.md)

### Current Project Health
- ✅ Core features complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ HACS validation passing
- ✅ No known critical bugs
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ⏳ Awaiting wider user feedback
- ⏳ Monitoring for edge cases in real-world usage
